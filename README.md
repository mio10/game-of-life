# Game of Life in Processing

## Description
My implementation of Game of Life in Processing.

## Requirements
[Processing](https://processing.org) is required.

## Quick Start
### Windows
*(may work on Linux too but wasn't tested)*

**Note:** `path/to/gol` is a path to the directory containing `gol.pde`
